# Atliq Mart Supply Chain Analysis

## Problem Statement  

AtliQ Mart is a growing **FMCG manufacturer** headquartered in **Gujarat, India**. It currently operates in **three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara**, with plans to expand to other **metro and Tier-1 cities** in the next **two years**.  

However, AtliQ Mart is facing a **customer retention issue**, as some key customers **did not renew their annual contracts** due to service concerns. It is suspected that essential products were either:  
- **Not delivered on time**  
- **Not delivered in full**  
over an extended period, leading to **poor customer service**.  

To **resolve this issue before expansion**, management has asked the **supply chain analytics team** to track:  
- **On-Time Delivery (OT) %**  
- **In-Full Delivery (IF) %**  
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %**  

This data will be monitored **daily** for all customers to identify and fix service-related issues **immediately**.

  - **Ghee, curd, and butter.**  
- **No significant improvement in key metrics over the last few months.**  
- **A major gap exists in IF% for most customers.**
